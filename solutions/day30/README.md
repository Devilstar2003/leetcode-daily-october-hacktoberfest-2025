Problem Of The Day, 30th October, 2025: Minimum Number of Operations to Form a Target Array

This solution uses a Greedy Approach to find the minimum number of operations.
The minimum number of operations required is equal to the total sum of all positive increases observed as we scan the target array from left to right, starting from a baseline of zero.

- Initial Operation: The first element, target[0], must be built up from zero. This requires target[0] operations, so we initialize the total operations (ans) with this value.

- Subsequent Operations: For every subsequent element target[i]:

1. If target[i] > target[i-1] (An Increase): We need exactly target[i] - target[i-1] new operations. The previous operations cover the height up to target[i-1], and the difference covers the new increase. We add this difference to ans.

2. If target[i] <= target[i-1] (No Increase or a Decrease): No new operation is necessary at this step. The operations used to build up the previous, greater height (target[i-1]) already cover the current height (target[i]). We simply continue the existing operations up to this point (or let them end before this point) without starting a new one.

This logic is concisely captured by adding max(0, target[i] - target[i-1]) to the total count in each step.
